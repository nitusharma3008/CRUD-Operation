# Employee Management System
This is a simple Django-based application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee records. The app allows users to add, view, update, and delete employee information, including names, emails, positions, and salaries. It serves as a learning project to understand the basics of Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture.
